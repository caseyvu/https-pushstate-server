A simple static http/https file server that works with HTML5 Pushstate.

Defaults all routes to `index.html` in the given root directory. Treats all other files to be static, and routes urls with the given static directories to make them relative to root.

For example,

* `localhost` or `localhost/a/pushstate/route` will always return `index.html`.

* `localhost/assets/emoji.png` or `localhost/a/pushstate/route/assets/emoji.png` will always return `assets/emoji.png` when `assets` directory is given as one of the static directories.



### Install

`npm install -g git+https://github.com/caseyvu/https-pushstate-server.git`

### Usage

```shell
$ https-pushstate-server -r rootDir -p 8000 -s -c certFile -k keyFile -d assets,styles,scripts
```
